Problem approach
Boyce-Codd Normal Form or BCNF is an extension to the third normal form. For a table to satisfy the Boyce-Codd Normal Form, it should satisfy the following two conditions:
1. It should be in the Third Normal Form.
2. And, for any dependency A → B, A should be a super key i.e. for a dependency A → B, A cannot be a non-prime attribute, if B is a prime attribute

[10/19, 5:09 PM] Ruthika: Difference between primary key and unique key

Problem approach
A primary key is a special relational database table column(s) designated to uniquely identify each table record.
A primary key’s main features are:
1) It must contain a unique value for each row of data.
2)It cannot contain null values.
3)Every row must have a primary key value.

A unique key is a group of one or more than one columns of a table which uniquely identify database record. A unique key is the same as a primary key, but it can accept one null value for a table column. It also cannot contain identical values.
