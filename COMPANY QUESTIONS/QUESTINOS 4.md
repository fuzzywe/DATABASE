Then asked there are two tables suppose payment and order and you need to join them how you will do itâ€¦to which I answered common attribute should be there in order to join them.

Your answer is correct, as it reflects the basic concept of joining two tables based on a common attribute (often a key). However, to provide a more detailed and technical response, you can expand on the types of joins and their specific use cases. Here's a more detailed version of your answer:

### **Detailed Answer:**
"When joining two tables, such as **Payment** and **Order**, the first step is to identify a **common attribute** (or **key**) that links them together. Typically, this could be an **Order ID** or a **Customer ID**, which is present in both tables.

Depending on the relationship and what you want to retrieve, you can perform different types of joins:

1. **INNER JOIN**: 
   - This returns only the rows where there is a matching value in both the **Payment** and **Order** tables.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM Payment p
     INNER JOIN Order o ON p.OrderID = o.OrderID;
     ```
     This will fetch all the payments that have a corresponding order in the **Order** table.

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - This returns all rows from the **Payment** table and the matched rows from the **Order** table. If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the **Order** table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM Payment p
     LEFT JOIN Order o ON p.OrderID = o.OrderID;
     ```
     This will include all payments, even if they don't have a matching order.

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - Similar to LEFT JOIN, but this returns all rows from the **Order** table and the matched rows from the **Payment** table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM Payment p
     RIGHT JOIN Order o ON p.OrderID = o.OrderID;
     ```

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**:
   - This returns all rows when there is a match in either the **Payment** table or the **Order** table. If no match exists, the result will have `NULL` on the side that does not have a match.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM Payment p
     FULL JOIN Order o ON p.OrderID = o.OrderID;
     ```

### **Considerations:**
- The common attribute (like `OrderID`) must have the same datatype in both tables.
- Be mindful of **NULL values** in the common attribute when using LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN.

This way, depending on what data you need (all orders, only matching payments, etc.), you can choose the appropriate type of join to perform the operation."
