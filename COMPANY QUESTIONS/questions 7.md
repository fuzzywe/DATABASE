Then they gave me a situation of a

fraudulent debit transaction

that happened in the bank account of a user, “how will you deal with it?” (basically testing if had a

Quality Assurance

aspect as well)

I gave two possibilities. Firstly, if some third person has used the ATM pin of affected user to debit money, then there is no issue with our codebase. This has to be dealt with bank itself. Secondly, if there were number of fraudulent transaction in a small and same time span then we need to find the bug in our codebase. modular code testing, exception handling is what i suggested.

How will you tackle the problem of your database showing memory full in short term & long term?
In short terms, i’ll normalise the database to remove data redundancy along with it i’ll look for memory leakage and check for external or internal fragmentation. In long term i’ll move it to cloud or multiple data centres with load balancer between multiple DBs.

Then I was asked about hashing, indexing, and normalization from databases

transaction concurrency, SQL, and normalization, pulling information I could recall on the spot.

He asked me how i would delete duplicate entries from a table.

He asked me to draw an ER diagram for an attendance management system.

how i would delete duplicate entries from a table. I just explained him the logic and the SQL query i wrote down was garbage

write a sql query to find the count of employees having grade='3' and display their second highest salary from Employee table(Emp_id, grade, salary).

SQL basics: asked me to explain all keys with student database examples.

In which form data is stored in database?
What are the ACIDproperties?
DDL, DML, DCL & TCL (Complete explanation of each command) .
Concurrency control and questions related to serializibility..

SQL Queries: ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and writing some queries on the spot.

What are ACID properties.
What is Normalisation and its types.
What is the difference between Recovery and Restoration in a database.
